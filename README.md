# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David!

## About Moi
Self-taught software developer with over 2 years of experience crafting full-stack apps and wrangling cloud infrastructure.
I live and breathe {Java,Type}Script, but Iâ€™ve also made friends with React, Angular, Svelte, Java (yes, Java), C/C++, Golang, Python. ðŸ¤Ÿ

## What I Do (and Love):
- Frontend Wizardry: Building slick, intuitive UIs with TypeScript and modern frameworks.
- Backend Magic: SpringBoot for the big stuff, and dabbling in Python, C++, and Go for fun.
- Databases Galore: PostgreSQL, SQLite MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, DynamoDBâ€”you name it, Iâ€™ve probably set it up.
- AWS Power User: S3, Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, CloudWatch, Cognitoâ€¦ basically a Swiss Army knife for cloud services.
- My Setup: revolves around Linux, neovim, and the terminal because efficiency > everything.

# Why Youâ€™d Want Me Around:
Iâ€™m the kind of dev who dives into rabbit holes to truly get how things workâ€”whether itâ€™s debugging tricky code or optimizing workflows.
Iâ€™m equally at home solving problems solo or teaming up with sharp minds to build something awesome.

Letâ€™s connect and make something cool happen! To the MOOOON ðŸš€
